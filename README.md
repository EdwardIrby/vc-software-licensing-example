# Goal 
We have basic software license flow from a traditional server to a a client. Then I'll try and switch it over to VC. The idea is that you shouldn't have to have a centralized server to verify a software license. 

- Create software did
- Create schema for right use our software
- We're going to manually issue a vc the did
- On the client the  you enter this  did and it sends a request to server to verify you're authorized by checking the DWN
- 



# Notes
- Issue on changing tutorial example schema
- `name` is a reserved word don't use it as key in your schema
- Not clear that this is one or the other https://developer.tbd.website/docs/apis/ssi-service/#tag/CredentialAPI/paths/~1v1~1credentials~1verification/put
